## 🛡️ Security Implementation

### **Login Flow:**

   - **Owner** → `/admin/owner/dashboard`
   - **Agent** → `/admin/agent/dashboard`
   - **Player** → `/player/dashboard`

### **Route Protection:**
```php
// Owner only routes
Route::middleware(['owner.only'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/owner/dashboard', [OwnerDashboardController::class, 'dashboard']);
});

// Agent routes
Route::middleware(['check.role:Agent'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/agent/dashboard', [AgentDashboardController::class, 'dashboard']);
});

// Player routes
Route::middleware(['check.role:Player'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/dashboard', [PlayerDashboardController::class, 'dashboard']);
});
```
